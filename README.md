This repository contains a simple helicopter game implemented in C++ using OpenGL and GLUT. The game features a helicopter that the player can control to avoid obstacles while scoring points. The project showcases basic graphics programming concepts, user input handling, and game loop mechanics.

Features
User Control: The player can control the helicopter's vertical movement using mouse clicks or keyboard inputs ('w' to ascend and 's' to descend).
Dynamic Obstacles: Randomly generated obstacles that the player must avoid to keep the game going.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score based on the time survived and levels achieved.
Game Over Screen: Displays a game over message when the helicopter collides with an obstacle.

Technologies Used
C++
OpenGL
GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)
Windows API (for system calls)

How to Play
Run the compiled executable.
Press 'C' to start the game after the introductory screen.
Use the mouse to control the helicopter's ascent and descent.
Avoid the obstacles to keep the game going and increase your score.
